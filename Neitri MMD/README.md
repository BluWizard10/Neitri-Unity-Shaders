This is the shader I've been using, working on and testing for the last year and half.<br>
I really like how MMD models look in all the various rendered videos, I've been tring to get close to it.<br>
If you find world where this shader looks unaccepatable compared to others' please send me the world's name.<br>

This shader was made with the following goals in mind:
- Defaults values should be set to ideal battle tested values
- Should be noob friendly and easy to setup
- Look acceptably in all the various and scuffed lighting conditions of VRChat worlds
- When standard is completely dark, be dark too
- React to lighting and shadows better than Cubed's but still retain MMD look
- Be something between Cubed's and Unity's Standard
- Look natural in all worlds, but be more soft than Unity's standard


This is not an do it all PBR/Toon comprehensive uber shader like those of Xiexe or Poiyomi, this is a simple use then look good shader tailored specifically for VRChat.

# Import settings

If your shader is dark after using normal map, make sure you have this on your model import settings:

Shading ramps and matcaps look best with these import settings:
