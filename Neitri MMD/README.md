This is the shader I've been using, working on and testing for the last 1 year.<br>
I really like how MMD models look in all the various rendered videos, I've been tring to get close to it.<br>
If you find world where this shader looks unaccepatable compared to others' please send me the world's name.<br>

This shader was made with the following goals in mind:
- Should be noob friendly and easy to setup
- Defaults values should be set to ideal battle tested values
- Look natural in all worlds, but be more soft than Unity's standard
- Be something between Cubed's and Unity's Standard
- React to lighting and shadows better than Cubed's but still retain MMD look
- Look acceptably in all the various and scuffed lighting conditions of VRChat worlds

"Transparent ZWrite On" is for big meshes such as transparent hair.<br>
"Transparent ZWrite Off" is for small meshes such as blush.
